Me at my university in Gaza, studying Artificial Intelligence 💻  
A place where I learned how systems think, learn, and adapt.  
Most of it is gone now because of the war —  
I didn’t know these moments would become memories.

Two years of war. Displacement. Instability.

No excuses. No pause. Just persistence. 💪

## 💫 About Me (Where Old Meets New)

I’m an **AI student with a Dentistry dream** —  
not as two separate paths, but one future vision.

🔭 Currently working on **AI-powered dental systems & smart tools**  
that could help dentists diagnose and treat patients more efficiently,  
especially in challenging and limited-resource environments.

🌱 Learning how to combine **Deep Learning, Dental Imaging, and Intelligent Automation**  
to support real-world dental practice.

👯 Open to collaborations where **Dentistry meets AI, robotics, and engineering**  
— projects that aim for real impact, not just demos.

🤝 Always exploring **creative AI solutions and medical robotics ideas**  
focused on dentistry and healthcare innovation.

💬 Ask me about:
- Dental AI & imaging  
- AI in healthcare  
- Studying under pressure  
- Building resilience through learning  

⚡ Fun fact:  
I studied through war and displacement.  
Resilience is my strongest technical skill.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fdnBf7SclrZ_wOGEIYxyGxynSmyMKRjU" width="520"/>

Egypt 🇪🇬  
Where I’m studying my second major: **Dentistry** 🦷  
Proof that dreams don’t disappear —  
they adapt, evolve, and find new routes.

## 🧠 Final Thought

AI is what I study.  
Dentistry is what I love.  
And resilience is what defines me.

Still learning.  
Still building.  
Still dreaming.
