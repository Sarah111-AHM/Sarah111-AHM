## Sarah Abumandil
I am currently pursuing two parallel degrees in two completely different fields:
Artificial Intelligence (3rd year) at UCAS, Gaza, and Dentistry (2nd year) at Cairo University, Egypt.
My academic journey has been shaped by resilience and determination, continuing my education despite significant challenges and displacement

## My Journey

##Early Beginnings and Challenges

From childhood, I've been driven by curiosity and learning.  
My early academic focus laid the foundation for what would become my dual-path career in technology and healthcare.

I began my AI studies @ UCAS , immersing myself in machine learning, computer vision, and technological applications.  
These classrooms—now largely destroyed by conflict—were where I first discovered how technology could transform lives.

### War and Resilience

Two years of conflict and displacement tested my resolve.  
Studying between bombings, reviewing notes during displacement, and constantly relocating became my reality.  
Yet, I never stopped learning.

This period taught me that education persists even when institutions falter.

Continuing my education meant traveling to Egypt to study dental medicine.  
This transition represents both sacrifice and commitment—leaving home to follow a dream of combining healthcare with technological innovation.

My unique path combines artificial intelligence with dental medicine.  
I believe these fields naturally intersect, with AI offering revolutionary possibilities for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care in dentistry.

---

## Current Work

I'm developing AI-powered dental tools and concepts that can assist dentists in providing more accurate diagnoses and efficient treatments.

My interests include:
- Machine learning applications for dental imaging  
- Smart automation for clinical workflows  
- Accessible dental technology solutions

## What Drives Me

War changed my timeline but not my ambitions.  
Displacement taught me adaptability.  
Studying two demanding fields simultaneously requires discipline, but I'm motivated by the potential impact at their intersection.

My mother—an English instructor and public speaker.  
My role model, my strength, and my constant reminder that voice, education, and presence matter.
