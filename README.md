## Sarah Abumandil
I am currently pursuing two parallel degrees in two completely different fields:
Artificial Intelligence (3rd year) at UCAS, Gaza, and Dentistry (2nd year) at Cairo University, Egypt.
My academic journey has been shaped by resilience and determination, continuing my education despite significant challenges and displacement

## My Journey

## Early Beginnings and Challenges

![Early studying](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HLngsNYeF2sxvxJaYnmBSEsFC3I39y0F)

Since childhood, my world has been a bit different. I learned English and the British accent fluently because my parents often spoke in English at home. In my spare time, I read my father's books on medicine and IELTS tests. My childhood wasn't typical — most of it was spent among books. I wasn’t very social, perhaps because I was an only child, and we moved between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine, making it hard to settle in a stable environment.
I had a tough time during high school, facing challenges on several fronts, which made it difficult for me to achieve the grade needed to enter medical school initially. So, I applied to Artificial Intelligence at UCAS, Gaza, despite not being fully convinced about the program in Gaza due to the lack of infrastructure and skilled professionals in the field, as is widely known

### The Shift and Double Challenge
Over time, I began to accept the Artificial Intelligence major. I had already completed a whole semester in the field, and I started to find it enjoyable and fascinating. At the same time, my mother believed in my abilities and supported me to study Dentistry in Egypt, as my grades didn't allow me to pursue it in Gaza. I agreed because this was my childhood dream and something I excel at.
And then the idea came: 
#### why not study both fields and combine them in the future?

### University Years in Gaza

I began my AI studies @ UCAS , immersing myself in machine learning, computer vision, and technological applications.  
These classrooms—now largely destroyed by conflict—were where I first discovered how technology could transform lives.

### War and Resilience

During the displacement, most of the universities in Gaza stopped operating due to the poor conditions and ongoing conflict. However, I didn’t stop studying despite the worsening situation. I tried many times to leave Gaza through the Rafah crossing to continue my studies, but it was futile. We returned to online studying despite the lack of electricity and internet, and I managed to achieve an excellent GPA

This period taught me that education persists even when institutions falter.

### Pursuing Dental Medicine in Egypt

I studied Dentistry at Cairo University, one of the top universities in Egypt and the Arab world. I frequently traveled between Gaza and Egypt to balance both specializations. When the war broke out, I was stuck in Gaza and couldn’t continue my studies, but I returned stronger than ever.
I worked on carving and numbering teeth and built a movable jaw using teeth and wax on an articulator. Balancing Dentistry and Artificial Intelligence wasn’t easy — I went through many tough times and critical decisions, but I never wavered from my goal

### Dual Focus: AI + Dentistry

![Personal portrait](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1s4tbIeTnev30veXeEesaxbu-d3TZ-p7f)

My unique path combines artificial intelligence with dental medicine.  
I believe these fields naturally intersect, with AI offering revolutionary possibilities for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care in dentistry.

## Current Work

Current and Future Work
I am currently working on developing AI-powered dental tools that can assist dentists in providing more accurate diagnoses and efficient treatments.
Areas of Interest:
Machine learning applications for dental imaging and radiographic analysis
Smart automation for clinical workflows and dental clinics
Accessible and affordable dental technology solutions
Diagnostic systems using computer vision

---
### My Experience in Artificial Intelligence
Currently, I am an active member of the Palestine Quantum Computing Hackathon 2026 across universities in Palestine (both the West Bank and Gaza). I have completed several courses from prestigious universities like MIT and Stanford and participated in various initiatives and boot camps, through which I have built several useful projects and developed a strong network of talented peers.

## What Drives Me

War changed my timeline but not my ambitions.  
Displacement taught me adaptability.  
Studying two demanding fields simultaneously requires discipline, but I'm motivated by the potential impact at their intersection.

## Inspiration

My mother—an English instructor and public speaker.  
My role model, my strength, and my constant reminder that voice, education, and presence matter.

![With my mother](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sjcmSHVRO9cjsatCstALLV3I7DKA54_5)
My mother is an English instructor, not a dentist as some might assume. My father is a cardiovascular surgeon, and he was the one who always encouraged me to love medicine.

## Let's Connect

I'm interested in collaborating on projects that bridge healthcare and technology, particularly in dental applications.

**Focus:** AI in Dental Medicine, Healthcare Technology, Educational Resilience  
**Location:** Egypt / Gaza
