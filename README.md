I am currently pursuing two parallel degrees in two completely different fields:
Artificial Intelligence (3rd year) at UCAS, Gaza, and Dentistry (2nd year) at Cairo University, Egypt.
My academic journey has been shaped by resilience and determination, continuing my education despite significant challenges and displacement

## My Journey

## Early Beginnings and Challenges

Since childhood, my world has been a bit different. I learned English and the British accent fluently because my parents often spoke in English at home. In my spare time, I read my father's books on medicine and IELTS tests. My childhood wasn't typical — most of it was spent among books. I wasn’t very social, perhaps because I was an only child, and we moved between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Palestine, making it hard to settle in a stable environment.
I had a tough time during high school, facing challenges on several fronts, which made it difficult for me to achieve the grade needed to enter medical school initially. So, I applied to Artificial Intelligence at UCAS, Gaza, despite not being fully convinced about the program in Gaza due to the lack of infrastructure and skilled professionals in the field, as is widely known

### The Shift and Double Challenge
Over time, I began to accept the Artificial Intelligence major. I had already completed a whole semester in the field, and I started to find it enjoyable and fascinating. At the same time, my mother believed in my abilities and supported me to study Dentistry in Egypt, as my grades didn't allow me to pursue it in Gaza. I agreed because this was my childhood dream and something I excel at.
And then the idea came: 
#### why not study both fields and combine them in the future?

### University Years in Gaza

I began my AI studies @ UCAS , immersing myself in machine learning, computer vision, and technological applications.  
These classrooms—now largely destroyed by conflict—were where I first discovered how technology could transform lives.

### War and Resilience

Two years of conflict and displacement tested my resolve.  
Studying between bombings, reviewing notes during displacement, and constantly relocating became my reality.  
Yet, I never stopped learning.

This period taught me that education persists even when institutions falter.

### Pursuing Dental Medicine in Egypt

Continuing my education meant traveling to Egypt to study dental medicine.  
This transition represents both sacrifice and commitment—leaving home to follow a dream of combining healthcare with technological innovation.

### Dual Focus: AI + Dentistry

My unique path combines artificial intelligence with dental medicine.  
I believe these fields naturally intersect, with AI offering revolutionary possibilities for diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care in dentistry.

---

## Current Work

I'm developing AI-powered dental tools and concepts that can assist dentists in providing more accurate diagnoses and efficient treatments.

My interests include:
- Machine learning applications for dental imaging  
- Smart automation for clinical workflows  
- Accessible dental technology solutions

## What Drives Me

War changed my timeline but not my ambitions.  
Displacement taught me adaptability.  
Studying two demanding fields simultaneously requires discipline, but I'm motivated by the potential impact at their intersection.
